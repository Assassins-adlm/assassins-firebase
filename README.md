----------------------------GEO-ASSASSINS----------------------------------
A final project for a 4 man team, inspired by a highschool assassins game and a chance to work with lots of collected data. A browser based game where players select targets to mark while not getting marked by enemy players themselves. The app is performs best on Mobile. Location data is transmitted in real time and displayed on the map with special markers. Once a target is within range of each other, it will trigger the geo-fence around players and intiate fight scene to determine winner. At this time fight scene is undergoing re-design. Originally victims have an opportunity to evade marking if they were able to successfully guess who their assassin was. Currently implenting html5 gyroscope to make the fight scene more interative.
